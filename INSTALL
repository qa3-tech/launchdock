LaunchDock Installation Instructions
====================================

1. EXTRACT AND INSTALL BINARY
------------------------------

Extract the downloaded archive and copy the `launchdock` binary (or `launchdock.exe` 
on Windows) to a directory in your system PATH.

Common installation locations:
- Linux/macOS: /usr/local/bin/ or ~/.local/bin/
- Windows: C:\Program Files\LaunchDock\ (then add to PATH)

Alternative: Keep the binary anywhere and add its directory to your PATH.

2. START THE DAEMON
-------------------

Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

    launchdock start

This starts the background daemon that manages application discovery.

3. CONFIGURE STARTUP (RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------

Add `launchdock start` to your system startup to run automatically:

- Windows: Add to Startup folder or Task Scheduler
- macOS: Add to Login Items in System Preferences
- Linux: Add to your desktop environment's autostart applications

4. SET UP HOTKEYS
-----------------

Configure a keyboard shortcut in your OS settings to run: launchdock show

Platform-specific instructions:
- Windows: Settings → System → Keyboard → Advanced keyboard settings → App shortcuts
- macOS: System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts  
- Linux (GNOME): Settings → Keyboard → Custom Shortcuts
- Linux (KDE): System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts

Suggested hotkey combinations:
- Super+Space (recommended)
- Ctrl+Alt+Space
- Meta+Escape

5. VERIFY INSTALLATION
----------------------

Test your setup:

    launchdock status

Should show "Daemon: Running"

Press your configured hotkey - the launcher interface should appear.

6. USAGE
